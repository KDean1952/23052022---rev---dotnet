A document will go throught lots of changes during its lifetime
	(code file / .cs / .html / .css / .ts etc....)

we need to keep a track what changed from what
a new change will change the version of the file (eg. 1.0 to 1.1 to 1.2 to 1.3)
who changed it ?
at what time ?
some one will approve it reject it 

	GIT (introduced to the world by inventor of Linux system) - later purchased and maintained by MS

	everyday, I will be writing a lot of code, and I will push it to GIT Hub
	you will be able to pull it from there
